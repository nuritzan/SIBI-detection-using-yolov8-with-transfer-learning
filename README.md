# Indonesian Sign Language Alphabet Detection using YOLOv8 with Transfer Learning

## 📖 Overview
This project focuses on real-time detection of the Indonesian Sign Language (SIBI) alphabet using YOLOv8 with transfer learning. The system is designed to recognize hand gestures corresponding to the SIBI alphabet and provide accurate detection results in real time.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Google Colab (training)  
- PyCharm (real-time testing)  
- Roboflow (dataset annotation & preprocessing)  
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
